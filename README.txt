__________Othello_Rules________
The game begins with four coins placed in a square in the middle of the grid,
two facing yellow-side-up, two redk-side-up, so that the same-colored disks are on a diagonal. 

Red must place a piece (red-side-up) on the board and so that there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
occupied line between the new piece and another red piece, with one or more contiguous yellow pieces between them. 
Play always alternates. After placing a red disk, red turns over (flips to dark, captures) the single disk (or chain of yellow disks)
on the line between the new piece and an anchoring red piece.

Now yellow plays. This player operates under the same rules, with the roles reversed: yellow lays down a yellow piece, causing a red piece to flip

Players take alternate turns. If one player can not make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. 
When neither player can move, the game ends. This occurs when the grid has filled up or when neither player can legally place a piece in any of the remaining squares.
This means the game may end before the grid is completely filled. This possibility may occur because one player has no pieces remaining on the board in that player's color.
In over-the-board play this is generally scored as if the board were full 

The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins.
An exception to this is that if a clock is employed then if one player defaults on time that player's opponent wins regardless of the board configuration, with varying methods to 
determine the official score where one is required.
